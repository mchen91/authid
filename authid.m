% This script assumes these variables are defined:
%
%   inputs - input data.
%   targets - target data.
[PATHSTR,NAME,EXT] = fileparts(mfilename('fullpath'));
fileName =  fullfile(PATHSTR,'data.txt');
data = csvread(fileName);

% normalize data to between 0 and 1
normalizer = max(data(:));
bias = min(data(:));
inputs = (transpose(data(:,2:end)) - bias) / (normalizer - bias);
targets = full(ind2vec(transpose(data(:,1))));

% Create a Pattern Recognition Network
hiddenLayerSize = 7;
net = patternnet(hiddenLayerSize);

% Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 75/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 0/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 25/100;

% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,inputs,targets);

% Test the Network
outputs = net(inputs);
errors = gsubtract(targets,outputs);
performance = perform(net,targets,outputs)

% View the Network
